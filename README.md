# Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning models
This project has been developed to predict the target variable using various independent variables with the help of machine learning models. 
With this project, the goal was to solve the problem of predicting the accuracy of a vehicle insurance claim. 
This was done during my summer internship at Henotics Technologies Pvt Ltd, Hyderabad.
